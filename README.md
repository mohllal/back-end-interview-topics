- What is the **Strategy pattern**? How to use it to simplify the selection of algorithms/implementations at runtime?

```typescript
interface PaymentStrategy {
    processPayment(): void;
}

class CreditCardPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public processPayment(): void {
        console.log("Processing credit card payment...");
    }
}

class PayPalPayment implements PaymentStrategy {
    public processPayment(): void {
        console.log("Processing PayPal payment...");
    }
}

class PaymentProcessor {
    private strategy: PaymentStrategy;

    public setPaymentStrategy(strategy: PaymentStrategy): void {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public process(): void {
        this.strategy.processPayment();
    }
}

// Usage
const processor = new PaymentProcessor();
processor.setPaymentStrategy(new CreditCardPayment());
processor.process(); // Output: Processing credit card payment...
processor.setPaymentStrategy(new PayPalPayment());
processor.process(); // Output: Processing PayPal payment...
```

- What is the **Singleton pattern**? When should we use it?

```typescript
class ConfigurationManager {
    private static instance: ConfigurationManager;

    private constructor() {
        // private constructor to prevent instantiation
    }

    public static getInstance(): ConfigurationManager {
        if (!ConfigurationManager.instance) {
            ConfigurationManager.instance = new ConfigurationManager();
        }
        return ConfigurationManager.instance;
    }

    public loadSettings(): void {
        // load settings
    }
}

// Usage
const config = ConfigurationManager.getInstance();
config.loadSettings();
```

- What is the **Decorator pattern**? How to use it to extend objects dynamically while avoiding classes explosion?

```typescript
interface Coffee {
    cost(): number;
}

class ClassicCoffee implements Coffee {
    cost(): number {
        return 5.0;
    }
}

abstract class CoffeeDecorator implements Coffee {
    protected decoratedCoffee: Coffee;

    constructor(coffee: Coffee) {
        this.decoratedCoffee = coffee;
    }

    cost(): number {
        return this.decoratedCoffee.cost();
    }
}

class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    constructor(coffee: Coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    cost(): number {
        return super.cost() + 1.5;
    }
}

class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    constructor(coffee: Coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    cost(): number {
        return super.cost() + 0.5;
    }
}

// Usage
let coffee: Coffee = new ClassicCoffee();
let milkCoffee = new MilkDecorator(coffee);
let sugarCoffee = new SugarDecorator(coffee);
console.log("Milk coffee cost: " + milkCoffee.cost()); // Output: Cost: 6.5
console.log("Sugar coffee cost: " + sugarCoffee.cost()); // Output: Cost: 5.5
```

- What is the **Observer pattern**? When should we use it in event-driven programming?

```typescript
interface IPublisher {
    registerSubscriber(s: ISubscriber): void;
    removeSubscriber(s: ISubscriber): void;
    notifySubscribers(): void;
}

interface ISubscriber {
    update(temperature: number, humidity: number, pressure: number): void;
}

class WeatherData implements IPublisher {
    private subscribers: ISubscriber[] = [];
    private temperature: number;
    private humidity: number;
    private pressure: number;

    public registerSubscriber(s: ISubscriber): void {
        this.subscribers.push(s);
    }

    public removeSubscriber(s: ISubscriber): void {
        this.subscribers = this.subscribers.filter(subscriber => subscriber !== s);
    }

    public notifySubscribers(): void {
        for (const subscriber of this.subscribers) {
            subscriber.update(this.temperature, this.humidity, this.pressure);
        }
    }

    public setMeasurements(temperature: number, humidity: number, pressure: number): void {
        this.temperature = temperature;
        this.humidity = humidity;
        this.pressure = pressure;
        this.notifySubscribers();
    }
}

class CurrentConditionsDisplay implements ISubscriber {
    public update(temperature: number, humidity: number, pressure: number): void {
        console.log(`Current conditions: ${temperature}F degrees and ${humidity}% humidity`);
    }
}

// Usage
const weatherData = new WeatherData();
const currentDisplay = new CurrentConditionsDisplay();
weatherData.registerSubscriber(currentDisplay);
weatherData.setMeasurements(80, 65, 30.4); // Output: Current conditions: 80.0F degrees and 65.0% humidity
```

- What is the **Facade pattern**? How to use it to simplify and hide the implementation complexity of sub-systems?

```typescript
class DVDPlayer {
    on(): void {
        console.log("DVD Player on");
    }

    play(): void {
        console.log("DVD Player playing");
    }
}

class Projector {
    on(): void {
        console.log("Projector on");
    }

    wideScreenMode(): void {
        console.log("Projector in widescreen mode");
    }
}

class SoundSystem {
    on(): void {
        console.log("Sound System on");
    }

    setVolume(level: number): void {
        console.log("Sound System volume set to " + level);
    }
}

class HomeTheaterFacade {
    private dvdPlayer: DVDPlayer;
    private projector: Projector;
    private soundSystem: SoundSystem;

    constructor(dvd: DVDPlayer, proj: Projector, sound: SoundSystem) {
        this.dvdPlayer = dvd;
        this.projector = proj;
        this.soundSystem = sound;
    }

    watchMovie(): void {
        this.dvdPlayer.on();
        this.dvdPlayer.play();
        this.projector.on();
        this.projector.wideScreenMode();
        this.soundSystem.on();
        this.soundSystem.setVolume(10);
        console.log("Movie started!");
    }
}

// Usage
const dvd = new DVDPlayer();
const proj = new Projector();
const sound = new SoundSystem();
const homeTheater = new HomeTheaterFacade(dvd, proj, sound);
homeTheater.watchMovie(); // Output: various system on and playing messages followed by "Movie started!"
```

  FROM tbl1 a INNER JOIN tbl2 b
  ON a.col1 = b.col2
  ```
  
  - What will the outcome of the following **left outer** join query?

    - Join columns having **unique** values.
    - Join columns having **duplicate** values.
    - **One** Join table contains Null value.

  ```

- Consider the following `staffs` table:
  
  | id  | first_name | last_name | manager_id |
  | --- | ---------- | --------- | ---------- |
  | 1   | Genna      | Jakson    | NULL       |
  | 2   | Adam       | Ahmed     | 1          |
  | 3   | Kali       | Boyer     | 2          |
  | 4   | Layla      | David     | 2          |
  | 5   | Ali        | Mohamed   | 3          |
  
  The `staffs` table stores the staff information such as `id`, `first_name`, and `last_name`. It also has a column named `manager_id` that specifies the direct manager.
  
  Use **self join** and **recursive common table expression (CTE)** to get who reports to whom?
